	<h2>What are graphics card and what do they do?</h2>
	<p>The graphics processing unit, or GPU, has become one of the most important types of computing technology, both for personal and business computing.</p>
	<p>Designed for parallel processing, the GPU is used in a wide range of applications, including graphics and video rendering.<br>
	Although they’re best known for their capabilities in gaming, GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).
	</p>
	<h2>"Dark side" of GPU use</h2>
	<p> In 2020 when COVID breakout happened and people were bound to stay inside and work from home many of them turned to cryptocurrency mining which caused GPU prices to spike.<br>
	<p> They are so called "miners" and with them buying too many cards they made demand way more than supply so manufacturers were running out of materials which they used to make GPUs in the first place.</p>
	<h2>What is GPU mining?</h2>
	<p>GPU mining is a crypto mining process that uses specialized graphics card cores to solve crypto puzzles and verify transaction blocks. Miners prefer GPUs as they can divide and process similar, repetitive, yet resource-intensive tasks faster with multiple cores.</p>
