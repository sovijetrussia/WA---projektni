			<!--MAIN ARTICLE-->
			<article>
				<p><strong>Similarities</strong> <br>
					The RTX 3070 TUF&#39;s design is nearly identical to that of the Asus RTX 3080 TUF, with a few minor adjustments. The 3070 has the same dimensions as the more potent 3080 and 3090 cards, but it weighs around 300g less. That's because the GPU and GDDR6 memory won't run as hot, so the heatsink isn't quite as bulky. The overall appearance is nearly the same as the higher-end Asus TUF models as well, though there are a few small differences in the backplate (there are a few extra cutouts on the 3070).</p>
				<p><strong>Power draw</strong> <br>
					While the reference 3070 has an official TGP (Total Graphics Power) of 220W, Asus doesn't explicitly list a TGP and instead recommends at least a 750W power supply. The 3070 TUF still requires dual 8-pin power connectors, just like the 3080 and 3090 variants, which is a bit interesting to see. Based on our power testing, it will be challenging to push the card beyond 300W, and an 8-pin plus 6-pin setup would have been sufficient, but it was probably easier to just keep the dual 8-pin connections used on other models.</p>
				<p><strong>RGB and lighting</strong><br>
					RGB lighting is present, but it's very tame compared to other GPUs. The TUF logo on the top of the card lights up, and there's a small RGB strip on the front edge of the card (linked to the same lights as the logo), and that's it. If you're after more bling, Asus has the Strix line for that. TUF is the more mainstream approach to design and aesthetics. Naturally, the Strix models cost more than the TUF models, with slightly higher factory overclocks and better cooling in addition to the extra RGB lighting.</p>
				<p><strong>Cooling<br></strong>
					The 3070 TUF has three 90mm fans, and they're the new style with an integrated rim that increases static pressure and helps improve airflow at the same RPM. Considering we saw very good results from the cooling on the higher power RTX 3080 TUF, the fans should be more than sufficient for the 3070 card. Asus also rotates the center fan clockwise, with the side fans spinning counterclockwise, which it says reduces turbulence and noise. Our testing (see below) generally confirms these claims.</p>
				<p><strong>1080p Gaming Performance</strong> <br>
					We've only tested one custom 3070 so far, which we'll highlight in bright red, with the reference 3070 Founders Edition in a darker shade. We've included both 'stock' (using the OC Mode) results and performance running our maximum manual overclock in the charts (we didn't run benchmarks using the Gaming Mode or Silent Mode). We didn't run the same overclocking tests on the Founders Edition back when we first tested it, but in the tests that we did run, we saw performance slightly higher than the Asus card gets using the OC Mode.</p>
				<p><strong>1440p Gaming Performance</strong><br>
					Running at 2560x1440 is generally the best balance between resolution and frame rate, especially since 144Hz 1440p displays are relatively affordable — you can even get FreeSync and G-Sync Compatible IPS displays for around $300-$400(opens in new tab), which is what we recommend for most people. Performance drops on average by approximately 20 percent compared to 1080p, but all of the games continue to run at more than 60 fps, outside of the two games where we've enabled DXR (Dirt 5 and Watch Dogs Legion — though WDL does have the option to use DLSS, which we haven't done here.)</p> 
				<p><strong>4K Gaming Performance</strong><br>
					As we noted in our RTX 3070 Founders Edition review, it's basically as fast as the previous generation RTX 2080 Ti. That's despite the 8GB VRAM limitation — and it's definitely a limitation. For example, Watch Dogs Legion really doesn't seem to care for 8GB cards when all the settings are maxed out. DLSS helps, but we had to run the benchmark numerous times for the results shown in the gallery, as often we'd get stuck with extremely low performance. Overall, 4K remains viable, but it's just not the same experience as 1440p 144Hz.

					The overall rankings don't change compared to the lower resolutions, though individual games may show a few position swaps. The gap between the 3070 and 3080 meanwhile continues to grow. It was only 15 percent at 1080p, then 20 percent at 1440p, and now it's 30 percent at 4K. Part of that is due to CPU bottlenecks at lower resolutions, but the extra 2GB definitely helps the 3080 in some games at 4K. We're also curious to see whether Nvidia will actually do a 3070 Ti with 16GB (or 3070 Super or whatever it decides to call it). Still, considering the ongoing GDDR6 shortages, that may not happen for a while.</p>
