			<!--MAIN ARTICLE-->
			<article>
				<p>Looking at the prices of both graphics cards, there's really no reason why you should purchase the AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. It's an older card using an older AMD architecture, yet costs about the same (if not more for AIB cards). The AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is much faster, newer, and won't cost you more. If you're choosing between the two for a new GPU, go with the RX 7900 XT. But then if we were to include the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX into the mix, the RX 7900 XT itself looks like a bad deal. For an additional $100 more, you get better performance overall, as well as better performance per dollar. We've looked at the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT vs. Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which you should check for more details on how these two cards compare.</p>
				<p>The RX 6900 XT can still be found at countless retailers, though AIB cards are usually priced higher than the MSRP, meaning you can expect to pay out more than $1,000 on the older card. The two new GPUs are listed at MSRP for reference design cards and similar pricing to the RX 6900 XT for aftermarket options.</p>
				<p>There are considerable differences between RDNA 2 and RDNA 3. Instead of focusing solely on performance, AMD spent much of its effort on improving efficiency across the board to extract as much performance as possible per watt. AMD managed this by making use of TSMC's 5nm manufacturing process technology, a considerable step up from RDNA 2 and 7nm.</p>
				<p>To take full advantage of the 5nm process, AMD brought across its chiplet design from CPUs to the RDNA 3 GPUs, effectively splitting up the graphics and memory dies. Because RDNA 2 used the traditional monolithic die configuration, AMD promised up to 50% performance-per-watt gains over RDNA 2, and we saw positive results in our reviews.</p>
				<p>Even at 4K, the newer RDNA 3 architecture is able to help the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT offer more stable frame rates. Ray tracing at 4K isn't the best experience (as shown by our Metro Exodus findings) and this will hopefully be improved through future driver updates. After all, AMD is known to considerably improve a GPU over the course of its lifetime.</p>
				<p>If you're already using the RX 6900 XT and are happy with the performance at 1080p or 1440p, there's likely no reason to upgrade. The performance boost from the RX 7900 XT is considerable compared to its predecessor, but the RX 6900 XT is already capable of delivering solid frame rates at decent graphical settings.</p>
